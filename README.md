After landing on the homepage, users can navigate to any of the genre pages using the navigation bar or the links provided as images.

Once on a genre page, users have the option to bookmark individual author sections. Once a section has been bookmarked, a clip of that section will be saved to the Saved For Later page (saved for later page referenced as a bookmark item in the top right hand corner of the navigation bar). The section clips saved act as links back to the bookmarked author sections on the genre page.

The genre pages also offer a liked button next to each book series. This could be used to either highlight a series the user wants to read or allow the user to highlight the like button when they have read it. This is to be decided by the user how they wish to use it.

All icons clicked are stored to the local storage, so users can access their bookmarked and liked items when revisiting the page. The saved for later page has the option to 'clear all' which will delete all local storage data, except for the like buttons selected.
